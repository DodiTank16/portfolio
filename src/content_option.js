I specialize in the MERN stack, love clean code, and enjoy taking on new challenges to grow as a developer. Currently working at CMARIX, I'm exploring DevOps and diving deeper into micro frontends and scalable architecture. Beyond the code, you'll often find me spinning tracks and exploring the world of music production. Coding by day, beats by night!",

I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand my skills and contribute to the tech community.",
